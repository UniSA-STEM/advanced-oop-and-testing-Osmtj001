class Emclosure:
    def __init__(self, name, size, environment, animal_type):
        self.name = name
        self.size = size
        self.environment = environment
        self.animal_type = animal_type





# Enclosures are used to house animals and must include proper�es such as size,
# environmental type (e.g., aqua�c, savannah), and cleanliness level. Each enclosure is
# restricted to a single type of animal, meaning incompa�ble species should not be housed
# together (e.g., koalas should not be placed in a penguin enclosure). Enclosures should be
# able to report their current status and list the animals they contain. Your system should
# ensure that animals are only placed in enclosures that are appropriate for their species and
# environmental needs.
